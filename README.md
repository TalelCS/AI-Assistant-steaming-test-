# AI-Assistant-steaming-test-
this AI assistant is developed during my internship at MDweb i am asked to make the chatbot using the websocket technology and openAI ai assistants and the main problem was that the responses would take a lot to appear so i looked for the solution which i later found is the steam option so i tried developing it in this solution 

To use this bot add your OPENAI_API_KEY as a sys or account variable in your system variables configuration, 

after running the main.py file your bot will be ready to use at localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000
